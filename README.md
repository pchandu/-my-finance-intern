My Finance Intern is a financial data aggregator to help you make better trades by getting sense of social and corporate sentiment.

This website was created to help people get a sense of a stock's social and corporate sentiment before making a trade.

Social sentiment is derived from a public API called SocialSentiment.io. Their algorithm analyzes social media to see if people are posting positive or negative commentary about an inputted ticker and labels posts with a positive or negative score accordingly. This information is displayed on in the form of an interactive chart where you can toggle the data sets you would like to see.

Corporate sentiment is measured by Wall Street Analyst recommendations and price targets. The more BUY ratings given, the better the corporate sentiment, and vice versa. I included price target information to give you a sense of what analysts believe is a fair price for a given stock. This speaks to valuation sentiment and whether a stock is believed to be undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued. Financial data is supplementary.

Ratings, price targets, and financial data are all provided by IEXCloud.
